<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally. Make sure to have all the above technologies installed and updated to the latest version.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies in root folder and `client` folder

```
npm install
```

3. Firebase Setup:
- Go to Firebase Console, create a new project.
- Enable Firestore Database and Authentication (Email/Password).
- In your project, click the gear icon > Project settings > General > Your apps > Firebase SDK snippet > Config.
- Copy the config object and create a file named firebase-config.js in the project root:
  
```
     // firebase-config.js
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     };
```
- Security Rules: Update Firestore rules for basic security (see below).

4. Imgur Setup:
- The app uses a public Imgur Client ID for image uploads. For production, register your own Imgur application and update the Client ID in script.js.
  
5. Run the app:
- Open index.html in your browser.
